# CI/CD Workflow for Nix + Turborepo Monorepo
#
# This workflow demonstrates:
# - Building only changed apps using Turborepo
# - Building OCI images with Nix (no Docker required!)
# - Pushing images to GitHub Container Registry using skopeo
# - Generating image digests for deployment
#
# Key Features:
# - Fast: Uses unified caching strategy (actions/cache) for Nix, Turborepo, and pnpm
# - Deterministic: Nix ensures reproducible builds
# - Docker-free: Uses skopeo for OCI image operations
# - Secure: Uses GITHUB_TOKEN for registry authentication
